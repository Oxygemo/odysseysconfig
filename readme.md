# Odyssey's Config
This is a config made by, me. It aims to improve first-user experience by using some commands from other configs.  It shouldn't really affect performance, but a few tweaks for performance have been included that shouldn't affect the graphics. There are also some tweaks to help with crouch jumping, null-cancelling movement and Pyro panic button (bound to DEL key)
## Can I help?
Yes, you can help out with the config. Just fork the repository, do your changes, and make a pull request.
## Download sar?
Not now. Working on it.
## Recommended side-config
I recommend you use Mastercomfig as another config file. It is the best config to date, and can be expanded using modules. It's very well documented, too, if you're interested in that sort of things. Check it out [here](https://mastercomfig.com)
