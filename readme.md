# Odyssey's Config
This is a config made by, me. It aims to improve first-user experience by using some commands from other configs.  It shouldn't really affect performance, but a few tweaks for performance have been included that shouldn't affect the graphics.
## Can I help?
Yes, you can help out with the config. Just fork the repository, do your changes, and make a pull request.
## Download sar?

## Recommended side-config
I recommend you use Mastercomfig as another config file. It is the best config to date, and can be expanded using modules. It's very well documented, too, if you're interested in that sort of things. Check it out [here](https://mastercomfig.com)
## Customize sar?
Yes, yes you can. And if you do add some lines, please PR.
